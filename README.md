## Download and Install wkhtmltopdf
1. Go to: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

2. Choose your OS and download the package

3. Open the installer and follow the steps

## Download and Install pdftk
### For Mac 10.11:

### For Ubuntu:
1. Go here: https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/

2. Scroll down to the very bottom and follow these instructions: (pasted here, but go to the link because there are links)
  ```
  Build PDFtk Server
  You can compile PDFtk Server from its source code. PDFtk Server is known to compile and run on Debian, Ubuntu Linux,   FreeBSD, Slackware Linux, SuSE, Solaris and HP-UX.

  Download and unpack: pdftk-2.02-src.zip (~2MB)
  Review the pdftk license information in: license_gpl_pdftk/readme.txt.
  Review the Makefile provided for your platform and confim that TOOLPATH and VERSUFF suit your installation of gcc/gcj/libgcj. If you run apropos gcc and it returns something like gcc-4.5, then set VERSUFF to -4.5. The TOOLPATH probably doesn’t need set.
  Change into the pdftk sub-directory,
run make -f Makefile.Debian (substitute your platform’s Makefile filename)
  We have built pdftk using gcc/gcj/libgcj versions 3.4.5, 4.4.1, 4.5.0 and 4.6.3. Pdftk 1.4x fails to build on gcc 3.3.5 due to missing libgcj features. If you are using gcc 3.3 or older, try building pdftk 1.12 instead.
  ```

# Build the Project
When you build the project for the first time, you need to build the workbook first:
```
$ racket build-workbook.rkt
$ racket build.rkt
```
From then on, if you are not making edits to the workbook, you shouldn't have to build the workbook.

# Making Changes
## Branch First!
Before making changes you should make your own branch from the development branch.
```
$ git checkout development
$ git checkout -b yourBranchName
```

## Changing a Unit to Have Different Text
One of the easiest changes to make is to change a unit from Algebra to CS content. If you want to update the text to Unit 1, you have to change the ```the-unit.scrbl``` file found here:
```
$ cd courses/bs1/units/unit1
$ ls
bootstraplesson.js	codemirror.css		exercise-list.rkt	images			pretty-printing.css	scheme2.js
box.gif			codemirror.js		homeworks		logo.png		runmode.js		the-unit.scrbl
```
Then, head back to the home APCSP directory and re-build the projet:
```
$ racket build.rkt
```
Then, you can find the HTML file here:
```
$ cd distribution/courses/bs1/units/unit1
$ ls
backlogo.png		easyXDM.min.js		pict_11.png		pict_18.png		pict_7.png		scribble-common.js
bootstrap-helpers.js	exercises		pict_12.png		pict_19.png		pict_8.png		scribble.css
bootstrap.css		index.html		pict_13.png		pict_2.png		pict_9.png		scribble_2.css
bootstraplesson.js	json2.min.js		pict_14.png		pict_3.png		pretty-printing.css	textbook.css
box.gif			logo.png		pict_15.png		pict_4.png		pyret-mode.js		wescheme-embedded.js
codemirror.css		pict.png		pict_16.png		pict_5.png		runmode.js
codemirror.js		pict_10.png		pict_17.png		pict_6.png		scheme2.js
```
From there, you can open index.html and you will see the changes you made!

## Pushing Your Changes to your Branch
After you have made some changes, you should push to your branch:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "The changes you've made"
$ git pull origin development
$ git push origin yourBranchName
```
*Note: You should pull from development before pushing to your branch to make sure there are no conflicts. 

## Merging Your CHanges to Development
After you have made substantial changes (or every Monday at 4pm) you should do a Pull Request into development. First, make sure you have pushed all of your changes to your branch. Follow steps above and double check by running:
```
$ git status
On branch development
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$
```
Then you should go onto GitHub, and go to the Repostory and click "Create New Pull Request":
![PullRequest1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drguthals/APCSP/master/PullRequest1.png?token=ABQN7ZvkagA1RAcdpMrg_Zx6kNFdY0ZOks5Y8RJ4wA%3D%3D)

Make sure that the base is development and the compare is your branch (clara in this example):
![PullRequest2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drguthals/APCSP/master/PullRequest2.png?token=ABQN7aawhEfRNt_ItIE5rJbw6sihWjpOks5Y8RKZwA%3D%3D)

Do this by Mondays at 5pm. Then Sarah will accept your merge, and you will have until Wednesdays at 11am to test all of the changes on the development branch. (Hosting TBA).

# Pushing Your Changes to the Master
If needed, Sarah approves merge from Development into Master on Wednesdays at 11am and testing of the master branch should be complete by Thursdays at 11am.

## Building the Project
To generate the curriculum under a different tagging context, provide additional arguments to the build.rkt program.  e.g:
```
$ racket build.rkt pedagogy group
```
Under DrRacket, you can change your Language settings to include the tags as custom command line arguments.

## Installing Octokit
### For Windows
1. Go to: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-sguthals
2. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio. Follow the installation steps.
3. Once installed, in the package selection window, select .NET extension packages. Ignore the Mobile and Gaming extensions since there is no need for them.
4. Create your project using .NETFramework, Version 4.5 or .NETCore, Version 4.5.1. Octokit is only compatible with these versions.
5. Got to Tools and select NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console
6. In the console type the command "Install-Package Octokit".

*Note: Run tests using Ctrl+F5 to keep the output window from instantly closing.
